# Germination & Early Plant Shipping Guide

## Overview

The Seed Box Bag Box germination service allows us to ship plants back to customers during the **early sprouting phase**, rather than waiting for full maturity. This provides customers with young, healthy plants they can grow themselves.

## Benefits of Early Plant Shipping

### For Customers

- 🎯 **Lower Risk**: Germination success already verified
- 📚 **Learning**: Experience transplanting and growing from young plants
- ⏰ **Faster Results**: Skip the waiting period for germination
- 💚 **Higher Success Rate**: Professional germination conditions

### For Operations
- 🔄 **Faster Turnover**: Ship plants sooner, cycle inventory faster
- 💰 **Value Add**: Premium service customers will pay for
- 📦 **Space Efficiency**: Free up greenhouse space after 2-3 weeks
- 🎨 **Differentiation**: Unique service offering

## Germination Phases
