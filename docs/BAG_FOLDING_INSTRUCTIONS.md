# Bag Folding & Packaging Instructions

## The Trapezoid Butterfly Method

This specialized folding method creates a compact, cube-shaped package that protects cleaned bags during return shipping to customers.

## Overview

The trapezoid butterfly method transforms a flat shopping bag into a compact cube by:
1. Creating trapezoid "wings" on each side
2. Twisting handles inward
3. Applying shipping label over the wing shape
4. Covering with perforated sticker for easy tear-off
5. Folding and taping to create a cube shape

## Materials Needed

- Clean, dried shopping bag
- Shipping label (generated via ShipStation)
- Perforated sticker (custom printed with cut line)
- Packing tape (2" wide recommended)
- Roller cutter (for perforating stickers)
- Clean work surface

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Preparation
**Instruction**: Lay the bag flat on a clean surface with handles facing up.

**Details**:
- Ensure bag is completely dry from cleaning process
- Smooth out any wrinkles
- Handles should be untangled and visible at the top
- Work surface should be clean and dry

**Quality Check**: ✓ Bag is flat, handles are visible, no moisture present

---

### Step 2: First Wing (Left Side)
**Instruction**: Fold a trapezoid shape on the left side, creating the first wing.

**Details**:
- Start from the bottom left corner
- Fold inward at approximately 45° angle
- The fold should create a trapezoid with the wider base at the bottom
- The top of the trapezoid should align with the handle attachment point
- Smooth the fold firmly

**Visual Guide**:

+--------+            +---+----+
|        |            |  /     |
|        |     →      | /      |
|        |            |/       |
+--------+            +--------+
```

**Quality Check**: ✓ Clean fold line, trapezoid shape visible

---

### Step 3: Second Wing (Right Side)
**Instruction**: Fold a matching trapezoid on the right side, forming the second wing of the butterfly.

**Details**:
- Mirror the fold from Step 2
- Should create symmetrical wings
- The center of the bag now resembles a butterfly body
- Wings should be equal size

**Visual Guide**:
```
After Step 2:         After Step 3:
+---+----+            +---+----+---+
|  /     |            |  /\    /  |
| /      |     →      | /  \  /   |
|/       |            |/    \/    |
+--------+            +-----------+
  (Butterfly wing shape visible)
```

**Quality Check**: ✓ Symmetrical wings, butterfly shape apparent

---

### Step 4: Handle Twist
**Instruction**: Twist both handles inward toward the center of the butterfly shape.

**Details**:
- Grasp both handles together
- Twist them inward (toward the center)
- Make 1-2 complete rotations
- Handles should lay flat against the center "body" of the butterfly
- This secures the wings in place

**Quality Check**: ✓ Handles are twisted together, laying flat in center

---

### Step 5: Shipping Label Application
**Instruction**: Place the shipping label over the wing shape, covering the center.

**Details**:
- Position label to cover the twisted handles
- Label should span from one wing to the other
- Ensure label adheres smoothly without bubbles
- Label should be centered over the butterfly "body"
- Press firmly to secure

**Important**: The label provides structural integrity to the fold

**Quality Check**: ✓ Label centered, no bubbles, covers handles

---

### Step 6: Perforated Sticker Application
**Instruction**: Cover the label completely with a perforated sticker that has a cut line.

**Details**:
- Custom sticker has a pre-designed perforation pattern
- Sticker should completely cover the shipping label
- Contains easy-tear line for customer access
- Branded with "Seed Box Bag Box" logo
- Perforation line runs horizontally across center

**Customer Benefit**: Easy tear-off to access return label without damaging it

**Quality Check**: ✓ Sticker fully covers label, perforation line visible

---

### Step 7: Roller Cutting (Production Process)
**Instruction**: The sticker will be cut with rollers to create an easy-tear perforated shipping label.

**Details** (Production Team):
- Use rotary perforation roller
- Run along pre-printed cut line
- Pressure should be consistent
- Creates clean tear line without completely separating sticker
- Quality check: Test perforation on sample

**Note**: This step is performed during production, not by customer

**Quality Check**: ✓ Perforation is clean and consistent, easy to tear

---

### Step 8: First Fold
**Instruction**: Bend each halved sticker-covered half of the bag.

**Details**:
- The perforation line from Step 7 serves as a guide
- Fold the entire package in half along the perforation
- Each "half" includes one butterfly wing
- Create a sharp crease
- The package now resembles a thick rectangle

**Quality Check**: ✓ Clean fold, halves are equal size

---

### Step 9: Final Cubing & Taping
**Instruction**: Wrap tape completely around each half, creating a compact cube shape resembling a Rubik's cube.

**Details**:
- Take one half from Step 8
- Fold the sides inward to create a cube
- The package should be roughly square from all sides
- Wrap packing tape completely around the package:
  - Horizontally (around the middle)
  - Vertically (around the sides)
  - Diagonally (for extra security)
- Create at least 2-3 complete wraps
- Tape should overlap for strength
- Final shape should be compact and cube-like

**Target Dimensions**: Approximately 3" x 3" x 3" cube
**Target Weight**: 2-4 oz per package

**Quality Check**: 
- ✓ Cube shape achieved
- ✓ Tape is secure with no loose ends
- ✓ Package feels solid and compact
- ✓ Shipping label visible through opening
- ✓ Resembles a small Rubik's cube

## Quality Control Checklist

Before shipping, verify:
- [ ] Butterfly wings are symmetrical
- [ ] Handles are twisted and secured
- [ ] Shipping label is centered and visible
- [ ] Perforated sticker is properly applied
- [ ] Perforation line is clean and functional
- [ ] Package is cubic shape (not lopsided)
- [ ] Tape is secure with no loose ends
- [ ] Package dimensions are consistent (3" x 3" x 3")
- [ ] Package passes drop test (6" drop without opening)
- [ ] Label is legible and barcode scans correctly

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Wings won't stay folded
**Solution**: Ensure handles are twisted tightly enough. Add extra tape if needed.

### Issue: Cube shape is lopsided
**Solution**: Redistribute the bag material evenly before final taping. Ensure wings are symmetrical.

### Issue: Perforation won't tear cleanly
**Solution**: Adjust roller pressure during production. Test each batch.

### Issue: Package is too bulky
**Solution**: Compress air out of bag before folding. Ensure wings are tight.

### Issue: Tape won't stick
**Solution**: Ensure surface is dry and clean. Use high-quality packing tape.

## Production Efficiency Notes

### Average Time Per Package
- Experienced folder: 60-90 seconds
- New employee: 2-3 minutes
- Target: 90 seconds per package

### Batch Processing
- Fold bags in batches of 10
- Apply labels in batch
- Apply stickers in batch
- Run perforation roller in batch
- Final cubing and taping individually

### Workspace Setup
- Clear table 4' x 6' minimum
- Tape dispenser within reach
- Label printer nearby
- Sticker roll dispenser
- Collection bin for finished packages
- Quality control inspection station

## Safety Considerations

- Keep work area clean and dry
- Watch for paper cuts from bag edges
- Use caution with roller cutter (sharp)
- Ensure proper ventilation if bags smell (cleaning residue)
- Wash hands regularly
- Use ergonomic practices (standing mat, varied tasks)

## Sustainability Notes

This folding method:
- ✅ Minimizes packaging waste (uses the bag itself as primary packaging)
- ✅ Reduces shipping volume (compact cubes)
- ✅ Protects bags for reuse
- ✅ Uses minimal additional materials (just label, sticker, tape)
- ✅ Enables efficient shipping logistics
