## Seed Safety Considerations

### Regulatory Framework
- Seeds intended for planting generally fall under USDA APHIS regulations
- Seeds for consumption (e.g., sprouting) fall under FDA jurisdiction
- State regulations may also apply

### Contamination Risks for Seeds
1. **Bacterial contamination during growing season**
2. **Storage contamination** (moisture, temperature)
3. **Cross-contamination** during collection and processing
4. **Fungal growth** during storage

### Best Practices for Seed Collection
- ✅ Visual inspection for disease/damage
- ✅ Proper drying before storage
- ✅ Separate storage by species
- ✅ Testing for germination rates
- ✅ Quarantine period for new acquisitions
- ✅ Documentation of source and handling

## Greenhouse & Growing Regulations

### USDA Requirements
- Plant quarantine regulations (state-to-state movement)
- Pest management regulations
- Organic certification requirements (if applicable)

### State-Specific Regulations
- Agricultural permits
- Water use permits
- Environmental compliance
- Nursery licensing

### Cannabis-Specific Considerations
⚠️ **SPECIAL REGULATORY CATEGORY** ⚠️

For cannabis cultivation (referenced in "phenotype" requirements):
- State-specific cannabis licensing required
- Strict tracking and tracing requirements
- Separate facility and operational requirements
- Federal vs. state law conflicts
- Consult cannabis regulatory attorney

## Contamination Prevention Protocols

### Spatial Quarantine Requirements
1. **New Plant Quarantine**
   - Minimum 14-day isolation
   - Visual inspection daily
   - Testing before introduction to main greenhouse

2. **Disease Detection Response**
   - Immediate isolation of affected plants
   - 3-5 meter minimum distance from healthy plants
   - Air circulation considerations
   - Tool sterilization between zones

3. **Phenotype Isolation** (for cannabis)
   - Separate ventilation zones
   - Minimum distance based on flowering type
   - Prevent cross-pollination

### Sanitation Protocols

#### Bag Cleaning Process
- Initial inspection and sorting
- Removal of organic matter
- Washing with approved sanitizers
- Drying to prevent mold growth
- Final inspection
- Quarantine period before reuse

#### Equipment Sanitation
- Daily cleaning of tools and surfaces
- Use of EPA-registered sanitizers
- Rotation of equipment between zones
- Sterilization protocols for high-risk activities

## Required Testing & Documentation

### Recommended Testing Schedule
- **Water Quality**: Monthly for growing operations
- **Soil Testing**: Annually or as needed
- **Product Testing** (for edible crops):
  - Pathogen testing (Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria)
  - Heavy metals (if soil history unknown)
  - Pesticide residues (if chemicals used)

### Documentation Requirements
- Seed source tracking
- Growing conditions logs
- Pest and disease monitoring
- Harvest and processing records
- Distribution and sales records
- Customer complaint tracking

## Action Items for Compliance

### Immediate Priorities
1. ⚠️ Consult with food safety attorney
2. ⚠️ Consult with agricultural compliance expert
3. ⚠️ Determine specific licenses/permits required by state
4. ⚠️ Establish relationship with testing laboratory
5. ⚠️ Develop HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points) plan
6. ⚠️ Create traceability system for all products
7. ⚠️ If handling cannabis: Obtain separate legal review

### Ongoing Requirements
- Regular monitoring of FDA/USDA recall databases
- Subscription to regulatory update services
- Annual review of procedures
- Staff training on food safety
- Environmental monitoring

## Insurance & Liability

### Required Coverage
- Product liability insurance
- Agricultural operations insurance
- General liability
- If applicable: Cannabis-specific coverage

### Risk Management
- Customer waivers and disclosures
- Clear labeling about edibility and safety
- Warnings about allergens and contamination risks
- Procedures for customer complaints and adverse events
